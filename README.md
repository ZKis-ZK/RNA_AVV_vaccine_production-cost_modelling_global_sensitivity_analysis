• the SuperPro Designer Version 12, Build 2 (Intelligen, Inc.) model for AVV vaccine drug substance production process using wild-type UTP (non-modified uridine-5'-triphosphate) at the 2000 L bioreactor working volume scale: "AVV_vaccine_DS_production_modelling_2000L.spf”;

The techno-economic modelling was carried out in SuperPro Designer v11 and v12. SuperPro Designer is available from:

Global sensitivity analysis was performed using SobolGSA Version 3.1.1. SobolGSA is available from:
https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/research/free-software/sobolgsa-software/ 

SuperPro Designer was interfaced with SobolGSA using excel VBA and MatLab, to automate the global sensitivity analysis.:
